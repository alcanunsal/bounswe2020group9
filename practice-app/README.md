### Currently works on PyCharm -> Flask app

The application did work on my workspace and as AWS server, but I manually copied it into the repository. If it does not work for some reason, that might be that case.

The main reason it might not work is if python can't find *flask*. PyCharm calls flask from somewhere else that I don't know yet, so its best to work on this project via PyCharm.
